# Authentication
For the following examples, relevant credentials can be found in the Azure Portal.

Steps to access:
1. Login to the home page of the Azure Portal
2. Navigate to "Azure Active Directory" using the three bars in the top right corner of the portal
3. Select "App registrations" in the navigation panel on the left
4. Search for and select your relevant application
5. In the application's "Overview" page, the client id can be found under "Application (client) id"
6. In the application's "Certificates & Secrets" page, the client secret can be found under the "Value" of the "Client Secrets." If there is no client secret yet, create one here.


# Working with SharePoint API

   The `ClientContext` client provides the support for a legacy SharePoint REST and OneDrive for Business REST APIs, 
   the list of supported versions: 
   -   [SharePoint 2013 REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/jj860569.aspx) and above 
   -   [SharePoint Online REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/get-to-know-the-sharepoint-rest-service)
   -   OneDrive for Business REST API

### Authentication

   The following auth flows are supported:

#### 1. Using a SharePoint App-Only principal (client credentials flow)

   This auth method is compatible with SharePoint on-premises and still relevant 
   model in both SharePoint on-premises as SharePoint Online, 
   the following methods are available: 

   - `ClientContext.with_credentials(client_credentials)` 
   - `ClientContext.with_client_credentials(client_id, client_secret)`
  
   Usage:
   ``` 
   client_credentials = ClientCredential('{client_id}','{client_secret}')
   ctx = ClientContext('{url}').with_credentials(client_credentials)
   ```
  
   Documentation:
   - [Granting access using SharePoint App-Only](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azureacs)  
   - [wiki](https://github.com/vgrem/Office365-REST-Python-Client/wiki/How-to-connect-to-SharePoint-Online-and-and-SharePoint-2013-2016-2019-on-premises--with-app-principal)
  
   Example: [connect_with_app_principal.py](examples/sharepoint/connect_with_app_only_principal.py)
  
#### 2. Using username and password 

   Usage:
   ``` 
   user_credentials = UserCredential('{username}','{password}')
   ctx = ClientContext('{url}').with_credentials(user_credentials)
   ```
  
   Example: [connect_with_user_credential.py](examples/sharepoint/connect_with_user_credential.py)
  
#### 3. Using an Azure AD application (certificate credentials flow) 

  Documentation: 
   - [Granting access via Azure AD App-Only](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azuread)  
   - [wiki](https://github.com/vgrem/Office365-REST-Python-Client/wiki/How-to-connect-to-SharePoint-Online-with-certificate-credentials) 
  
  Example: [connect_with_client_certificate.py](examples/sharepoint/connect_with_client_certificate.py)

#### 4. interactive

   to login interactively i.e. via a local browser

   Prerequisite: 
   
   > In Azure Portal, configure the Redirect URI of your
   "Mobile and Desktop application" as ``http://localhost``.

  Example: [connect_interactive.py](examples/sharepoint/connect_interactive.py)

  Usage:
  ```python
  ctx = ClientContext(site_url).with_interactive(tenant_name_or_id, client_id)
  me = ctx.web.current_user.get().execute_query()
  print(me.login_name)
  ```

### Examples
 
There are **two approaches** available to perform API queries:

1. `ClientContext class` - where you target SharePoint resources such as `Web`, `ListItem` and etc (recommended)
 
```python
from office365.runtime.auth.user_credential import UserCredential
from office365.sharepoint.client_context import ClientContext
site_url = "https://{your-tenant-prefix}.sharepoint.com"
ctx = ClientContext(site_url).with_credentials(UserCredential("{username}", "{password}"))
web = ctx.web
ctx.load(web)
ctx.execute_query()
print("Web title: {0}".format(web.properties['Title']))
```
or alternatively via method chaining (a.k.a Fluent Interface): 

```python
from office365.runtime.auth.user_credential import UserCredential
from office365.sharepoint.client_context import ClientContext
site_url = "https://{your-tenant-prefix}.sharepoint.com"
ctx = ClientContext(site_url).with_credentials(UserCredential("{username}", "{password}"))
web = ctx.web.get().execute_query()
print("Web title: {0}".format(web.properties['Title']))
```


2. `RequestOptions class` - where you construct REST queries (and no model is involved)

   The example demonstrates how to read `Web` properties:
   
```python
import json
from office365.runtime.auth.user_credential import UserCredential
from office365.runtime.http.request_options import RequestOptions
from office365.sharepoint.client_context import ClientContext
site_url = "https://{your-tenant-prefix}.sharepoint.com"
ctx = ClientContext(site_url).with_credentials(UserCredential("{username}", "{password}"))
request = RequestOptions("{0}/_api/web/".format(site_url))
response = ctx.pending_request().execute_request_direct(request)
json = json.loads(response.content)
web_title = json['d']['Title']
print("Web title: {0}".format(web_title))
```

The list of examples:

- Working with files
  - [download a file](examples/sharepoint/files/download.py) 
  - [upload a file](examples/sharepoint/files/upload.py)

- Working with lists and list items
  -  [create a list item](examples/sharepoint/lists/data_generator.py)
  -  [read a list item](examples/sharepoint/lists/read_large.py)   
  -  [update a list item](examples/sharepoint/listitems/update_batch.py)
  -  [delete a list item](examples/sharepoint/listitems/delete.py) 
  
Refer [examples section](examples/sharepoint) for another scenarios

# Working with Outlook API

The list of supported APIs:
-   [Outlook Contacts REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/api/contacts-rest-operations)
-   [Outlook Calendar REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/api/calendar-rest-operations)
-   [Outlook Mail REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/api/mail-rest-operations)


Since Outlook REST APIs are available in both Microsoft Graph and the Outlook API endpoint, 
the following clients are available:

- `GraphClient` which targets Outlook API `v2.0` version (*preferable* nowadays, refer [transition to Microsoft Graph-based Outlook REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/rest/compare-graph-outlook) for a details)   
~~- `OutlookClient` which targets Outlook API `v1.0` version (not recommended for usage since `v1.0` version is being deprecated.)~~


### Authentication

[The Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Python](https://pypi.org/project/msal/) which comes as a dependency 
is used as a default library to obtain tokens to call Microsoft Graph API. 

Using [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Python](https://pypi.org/project/msal/)

> Note: access token is getting acquired via [Client Credential flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow)
> in the provided examples. Other forms of token acquisition can be found here: https://msal-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

```python
import msal
from office365.graph_client import GraphClient

def acquire_token():
    """
    Acquire token via MSAL
    """
    authority_url = 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant_id_or_name}'
    app = msal.ConfidentialClientApplication(
        authority=authority_url,
        client_id='{client_id}',
        client_credential='{client_secret}'
    )
    token = app.acquire_token_for_client(scopes=["https://graph.microsoft.com/.default"])
    return token


client = GraphClient(acquire_token)

```

But in terms of Microsoft Graph API authentication, another OAuth spec compliant libraries 
such as [adal](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-python) 
are supported as well.   

Using [ADAL Python](https://adal-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)

Usage

```python
import adal
from office365.graph_client import GraphClient

def acquire_token_func():
    authority_url = 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant_id_or_name}'
    auth_ctx = adal.AuthenticationContext(authority_url)
    token = auth_ctx.acquire_token_with_client_credentials(
        "https://graph.microsoft.com",
        "{client_id}",
        "{client_secret}")
    return token

client = GraphClient(acquire_token_func)

```

#### Example

The example demonstrates how to send an email via [Microsoft Graph endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-sendmail?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http).

> Note: access token is getting acquired  via [Client Credential flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow)

```python
from office365.graph_client import GraphClient

client = GraphClient(acquire_token_func)

client.me.send_mail(
    subject="Meet for lunch?",
    body="The new cafeteria is open.",
    to_recipients=["fannyd@contoso.onmicrosoft.com"]
).execute_query()

```
